Machine learning algorithms are used in the applications of email filtering, detection of network intruders, 
and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, 
and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. The study of mathematical optimization 
delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems 
use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.
